## What is NunDB

NunDB is an open source real-time database, made to be fast, light and easy to use.

NunDB is written to be memory-safe and horizontal(soon) scalable.

We believe we can keep NunDB simple, and at the same time, it can power lots of different apps and use cases.

## Examples Use cases 

Checkout our examples of integration and see what we can do for your app

* [Vue.js + NunDB jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/2op63ctk/)
* [React.js Realtime Todo app](https://github.com/mateusfreira/nun-db-js/tree/master/examples/react)


# Installations

## Docker 

Running NunDB using Docker is likely the fastest method. The simplest steps to run NunDB with Docker involve running a container, as shown in the following example.

```bash
#Change user-name to the admin you want, user-pwd to the admin pwd you want, change /tmp to the directory where you want to store your data in the host computer... for dev /tmp works fine
docker run --env NUN_USER=user-name --env NUN_PWD=user-pwd --env NUN_DBS_DIR="/data" --mount type=bind,source="/tmp",target=/data -it --rm -p 3013:3013 -p 3012:3012 -p 3014:3014 --name nun-test mateusfreira/nun-db
```

## Docker-compose

```yaml

version: '3'
services:
  nun-db:
    image: "mateusfreira/nun-db"
    ports:
      - "3012:3012" # Web socket
      - "3013:3013" # Http
      - "3014:3014" # Socket
    environment:
      - NUN_DBS_DIR=/nun_data 
      - NUN_USER=mateus
      - NUN_PWD=mateus
    volumes:
        - /tmp/data/nun_db/:/nun_data
```

Note that the "/tmp/data/nun_db/" is a directory in the machine where the nun-db is running so you may need to create the directory for that use the command `mkdir /tmp/data/nun_db/`.


### Create the sample DB:

```

# First connect to the running container
docker exec -it nun-test  /bin/sh

# Then execute the command to create the database
nun-db -u user-name -p user-pwd create-db -d sample -t sample-pwd

# You should see something like
Response "valid auth\n;create-db success\n"

```

Once done, you now have NunDB running in your docker and exposing all the ports for use: HTTP (3013), WebSocket (3012), and Socket (3014)  you are ready to use.

debug pending-conflicts
# result (Must be connected to a database with use *** ***)

debug list-dbs
# result (List the name and the strategy of the dbs one on each line)
dbs-list
sample : none
vue : none
test : arbiter
analitcs-blog : none
$admin : newer

debug force-election
# Forces run an election immediately, which is useful if some node in the cluster is not responsive or to debug latency problems between nodes. Elections in NunDB are predictable and, unless the primary node is slow, the primary should not change even if you force an election.
```

### Arbiter
#### Context
- [ ] Require admin auth
- [x] Require db auth
- [ ] Replicate? How? ()
- [ ] Register Oplog? How? (no)

With the arbiter command one client register it self as an arbiter for conflicts, this client must be connected to the primary database.

```
arbiter
#result
ok|error
```

### CreateUser
#### Context
- [x] Require admin auth
- [x] Require db auth
- [x] Replicate? How? (Set command to security key)
- [x] Register Oplog? How? (As key value)

Creates a user for the selected user
e.gs
```
create-user $user $token
```


### SetPermission
#### Context
- [x] Require admin auth
- [x] Require db auth
- [x] Replicate? How? (Set command to security key)
- [x] Register Oplog? How? (As key value)

Creates a user for the selected user
e.gs
```
set-permissions $user_name $permissions $key_pattern|$permissions $key_pattern;

set-permissions foo rw test-*|rwi count;
# Grant permission to user called foo to read and write keys starting with test-, and read write and increment count key.
# Permissions latter
# r = Read,
# w = Write,
# i = Increment,
# x = Remove,

```


## Special keys

All special keys will have a `$` symbol in the first letter of the name.

### $connections

Count the number of connections to a database.

```
$connections
```

### $conflicts
* Key used to register client as arbiter for conflict resolution

## Secure keys
* All keys prefixed with `$$` will be considered secure by NunDB and will only allow database admin authentication to `set`, `get`, or `remove` them. These are useful if admins want to store information that should not be leaked to any client. 
* The key `$$token` cannot be removed even with admin credentials.



## Configurations

1. **NUN_USER**
   - **Default Value:** `nun`
   - **Description:** Username for NunDB, which can be overridden by command line.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_USER`
* This is the cluster admin user to be used in NunDB in real situation you shall not use the default value. It can be overridden by command line argument `--user`.

2. **NUN_PWD**
   - **Default Value:** `nun-pwd`
   - **Description:** Password for NunDB, which can be overridden by command line.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_PWD`
* This is the cluster admin password to be used in NunDB in real situation you shall not use the default value. It can be overridden by command line argument `-p`.

3. **NUN_DBS_DIR**
   - **Default Value:** `dbs`
   - **Description:** Directory where NunDB databases are stored.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_DBS_DIR`

4. **NUN_WS_ADDR**
   - **Default Value:** `0.0.0.0:3012`
   - **Description:** Address for NunDB WebSocket service.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_WS_ADDR`

5. **NUN_HTTP_ADDR**
   - **Default Value:** `0.0.0.0:3013`
   - **Description:** Address for NunDB HTTP service.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_HTTP_ADDR`

6. **NUN_TCP_ADDR**
   - **Default Value:** `0.0.0.0:3014`
   - **Description:** Address for NunDB TCP service.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_TCP_ADDR`

7. **NUN_REPLICATE_ADDR**
   - **Default Value:** `""`
   - **Description:** Address for NunDB replication service.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_REPLICATE_ADDR`

8. **NUN_LOG_LEVEL**
   - **Default Value:** `Info`
   - **Description:** Logging level for NunDB (Options: Off, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Trace).
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_LOG_LEVEL`

9. **NUN_ELECTION_TIMEOUT**
   - **Default Value:** `1000` (milliseconds)
   - **Description:** Timeout for leader election in NunDB clusters.
   - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_ELECTION_TIMEOUT`
* Configurations are available to define the timeout period for elections to wait until they are acknowledged from all nodes. It is important to note that you should rarely change this variable since doing so could make elections slower. The value of this variable should be at least twice the latency value to ensure that the election process runs smoothly.

10. **NUN_MAX_OP_LOG_SIZE**
    - **Default Value:** `1073741824` (1GB)
    - **Description:** Maximum operations log size before rotation.
    - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_MAX_OP_LOG_SIZE`
* Defines the max op log size in bytes, default value is 1G. NunDb keeps up to 10 uplog files each one containing at max 10% of the max size in bytes of the Oplog max size. When there are more than 10 oplog files the oldest one will be removed in the next time the declutter disk runs. Declutter run on a scheduler evert every 300s (5 minutes), that can be changed by the environment var NUN_DECLUTTER_INTERVAL that defines the interval second. That means when cleaning up space 10% of the operations are cleaned at a time.

11. **NUN_DECLUTTER_INTERVAL**
    - **Default Value:** `300` (seconds)
    - **Description:** Interval for decluttering, at decluttering time NunDB will snapshot pending databases to disk (or s3) and remove old not needed times.
    - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_DECLUTTER_INTERVAL`

12. **NUN_STORAGE_STRATEGY**
    - **Default Value:** `disk`
    - **Description:** Storage strategy for NunDB (Options: disk, s3).
    - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_STORAGE_STRATEGY`

* Defines how NunDB will store the data disk or s3, in case `s3` it will require may others configurations like `NUN_S3_API_URL`, `NUN_S3_BUCKET`, `NUN_S3_PREFIX`, `NUN_S3_KEY_ID`, `NUN_S3_SECRET_KEY` and it still requires configurations to a path to store data. E.g NunDB still stores oplog locally on the each node, when using s3 this file does not need to be durable if the process restarts.

13. **NUN_S3_KEY_ID**
    - **Default Value:** `nun-db`
    - **Description:** AWS S3 Key ID for S3 storage.
    - **Environment Variable:** `NUN_S3_KEY_ID`
